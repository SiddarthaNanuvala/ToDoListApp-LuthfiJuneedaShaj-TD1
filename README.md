# To-Do List Application

A simple React-based To-Do List application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. Users can add tasks, mark tasks as complete, delete tasks, and reorder tasks in the list.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Add new tasks to the list by entering text in the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
- **Mark as Complete**: Mark a task as completed. Completed tasks move to the top of the list and display "Completed" in the button.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list using the "Delete" button.
- **Reorder Tasks**: Move tasks up or down in the list using the arrow buttons (⬆️ and ⬇️).
- **Disable Movement for Completed Tasks**: Completed tasks cannot be reordered, and their move buttons are hidden.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing component state.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For logic and event handling.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.

## Task List Improvements

### Completed Tasks Positioning

In this update, we have made the following improvements to the task list behavior:

- **Completed tasks remain at the top of the list**: Completed tasks will always stay at the top, even when unfinished tasks are moved up using the "Move Up" functionality.
- **Unfinished tasks movement behavior**: The "Move Up" button can be used on unfinished tasks, but it will not affect the order of completed tasks.

### Documentation Update

The project documentation has been updated to reflect these changes in task management and provide clearer instructions on task handling. This ensures that users and developers understand the intended behavior for sorting tasks and how the system behaves when interacting with completed or unfinished tasks.
